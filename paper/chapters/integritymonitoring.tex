Integrity monitoring is a feature of both Shielded VM 
and Confidential VM that helps you understand 
and make decisions about the state of your VM instances.

You can view integrity reports in Cloud Monitoring 
and set alerts on integrity failures. 
You can review the details of integrity monitoring results in Cloud Logging.

During the Measured Boot of a Confidential VM instance, 
PCR[0] (a platform control register\footnote{\url{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6584-9_12}}) 
is updated with the value SEV.

\subsection{Automating responses to integrity validation events}
Integrity monitoring collects measurements from VM instances 
and surfaces them in Cloud Logging. 
Logs can be exported to Google Cloud Pub/Sub. 
We can create a cloud function that subscribes to this event stream 
and shuts down VM instances that fail integrity validation.
