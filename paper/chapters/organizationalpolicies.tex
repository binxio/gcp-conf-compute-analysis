The Organization Policy Service gives you 
centralized and programmatic control over your organization's cloud resources. 
As the organization policy administrator, 
you will be able to configure constraints across your entire resource hierarchy. 

These policies can be applied for individual projects.

\subsection*{constraints/compute.requireShieldedVm}
This boolean constraint, when set to True, 
requires that all new Compute Engine VM instances use Shielded disk images 
with Secure Boot, vTPM, and Integrity Monitoring options enabled.

\subsection*{constraints/compute.restrictNonConfidentialComputing}
The deny list of this list constraint defines the set of services 
that require all new resources to be created with Confidential Computing enabled.
By default, new resources are not required to use Confidential Computing. 
While this list constraint is enforced, 
Confidential Computing cannot be disabled 
throughout the lifecycle of the resource.
