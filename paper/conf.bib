	abstract = {AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) offers protection mechanisms for virtual machines in untrusted environments through memory and register encryption. To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing on the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This paper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs) by targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an attacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures that support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The presented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which enables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach, we can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake attestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without requiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware version of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract the endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware versions. With our findings, we prove that SEV cannot adequately protect confidential data in cloud environments from insider attackers, such as rogue administrators, on currently available CPUs.},

abstract = {The success of cloud computing has shown that the cost and convenience benefits of outsourcing infrastructure, platform, and software resources outweigh concerns about confidentiality. Still, many businesses and individuals resist moving private data to cloud providers due to intellectual property and privacy reasons. A recent wave of hardware virtualization technologies aims to alleviate these concerns by offering encrypted virtualization features that support data confidentiality of guest virtual machines (e.g., by transparently encrypting memory) even when running on top untrusted hypervisors. We introduce two new attacks that can breach the confidentiality of protected enclaves. First, we show how a cloud adversary can judiciously inspect the general purpose registers to unmask the computation that passes through them. Specifically, we demonstrate a set of attacks that can precisely infer the executed instructions and eventually capture sensitive data given only indirect access to the CPU state as observed via the general purpose registers. Second, we show that even under a more restrictive environment - where access to the general purpose registers is no longer available - we can apply a different inference attack to recover the structure of an unknown, running, application as a stepping stone towards application fingerprinting. We demonstrate the practicality of these inference attacks by showing how an adversary can identify different applications and even distinguish between versions of the same application and the compiler used, recover data transferred over TLS connections within the encrypted guest, retrieve the contents of sensitive data as it is being read from disk by the guest, and inject arbitrary data within the guest. Taken as a whole, these attacks serve as a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when the state of registers (e.g., in AMD's SEV) and application performance data (e.g. in AMD's SEV-ES) are left unprotected. The latter is the first known attack that was designed to specifically target SEV-ES.},
